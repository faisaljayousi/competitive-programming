# Competitive Programming Journey

This repo tracks my progress in competitive programming and data structures & algorithms (DSA). I'm using it to build speed and accuracy through consistent problem-solving.

Keeping it public helps me stay motivated and track progress over time. A full list of solved problems can be found [here](./problems.md).

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] Solve 30 problems rated 800‚Äì1000 on Codeforces
- [ ] Solve 30 Easy problems from NeetCode (two pointers, prefix sums, hashmaps)
- [ ] Solve NeetCode‚Äôs Easy/Medium Dynamic Programming section
- [ ] Solve 25 Medium problems on LC focused on sliding window, prefix sums, binary search
- [ ] Reach 1200+ on Codeforces by solving 1000‚Äì1100 problems
- [ ] Solve 20 Codeforces problems rated 1100‚Äì1300
- [ ] Complete full LC Medium+ DP and Binary Search sets
- [ ] Start virtual contests on Codeforces
- [ ] Reach 1400+ rating on Codeforces
- [ ] Build a pattern map
- [ ] ... more soon!
