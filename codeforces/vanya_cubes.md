## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement

Vanya got n cubes. He decided to build a pyramid from them. Vanya wants to build the pyramid as follows: the top level of the pyramid must consist of 1 cube, the second level must consist of 1â€‰+â€‰2â€‰=â€‰3 cubes, the third level must have 1â€‰+â€‰2â€‰+â€‰3â€‰=â€‰6 cubes, and so on. Thus, the i-th level of the pyramid must have 1â€‰+â€‰2â€‰+â€‰...â€‰+â€‰(iâ€‰-â€‰1)â€‰+â€‰i cubes.

Vanya wants to know what is the maximum height of the pyramid that he can make using the given cubes.

> Input: the first line contains integer n (1â€‰â‰¤â€‰nâ€‰â‰¤â€‰104) â€” the number of cubes given to Vanya.

> Output: print the maximum possible height of the pyramid in the single line.

## ðŸ§  Approach

We build the pyramid level by level. Each level `i` needs `i * (i + 1) / 2` cubes. At each step, we subtract the cubes needed from the total `n`, and stop when we canâ€™t afford the next level.
